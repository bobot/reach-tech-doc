FAQ
=============================

**Q: Where does MAX run?**

**A:** MAX runs on the Java virtual machine, so it works on all major platforms (MacOS, Windows, Linux, et al). It can run as a desktop application and a command line application. MAX can also run on a server, so that simulations can compute on a grid. 

**Q: How can I build my simulation with MAX?**

**A:** MAX includes tools and components useful for developing and testing simulation models written in the dedicated MAX API.

**Q: What are the benefits of using MAX?**

**A:** The main benefits are:

- **Expert friendliness**. MAX is a next generation API designed and built by computer scientists for computer scientists. Users are limited to a domain-specific language and thus they can exploit the full power of MAX and customize it as they need.

- **Modularity**. MAX is a development environment for building simulation models and components in a modular manner. An agent-based model is understood as a combination of other modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, agents, roles and environments are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.

- **Easy extensibility**. New models are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing models provide sufficient examples. Being able to create new models easily allows for total expressiveness, making MAX suitable for advanced research.

- **Model sharing**. Sharing agent-based models between AI organizations and experts is easy since MAX uses Maven to publish model information and to share binaries and/or source codes across several projects.

- **Work with Java**. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in the code of the general purpose programming language Java, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.
